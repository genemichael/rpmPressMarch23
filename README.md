This project uses React and Google Apps Script to support small printing businesses that need to manage their facilities, projects, quotes, customers, inventory, show floor, schedule, and invoicing. This is a work in progress.

The formatting might look funny, as it is designed to work from the Google Script IDE. You'll notice that instead of import { } from '', you will see all components wrapped in a <script type="text/babel"> tag, and const {} = library.
